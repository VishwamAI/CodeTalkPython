# English Interpreter Test Cases

## Objective
To validate the functionality of the English language interpreter by executing test cases written in plain English.

## Test Cases

### Basic Programming Constructs
- "Create a variable named 'counter' and set it to 5."
- "Increase the value of 'counter' by 3."
- "If 'counter' is greater than 7, print 'Success'."

### Complex Instructions
- "Define a function called 'calculate' that takes two numbers, adds them, and returns the result."
- "Call the 'calculate' function with 4 and 6 as arguments and store the result in a variable named 'sum'."

### Ambiguous Instructions Resolution
- "Sort the list without specifying the sorting criteria."
- "Draw a shape without mentioning the type of shape."

### Error Handling
- "Divide a number by zero and handle the potential error."
- "Try to access a non-existent file and manage the error gracefully."

### NLP Techniques Validation
- "Parse the sentence 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' and identify the verbs."

## Execution
These test cases will be executed by the English language interpreter as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure the system behaves as expected.
