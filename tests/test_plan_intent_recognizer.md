# Test Plan for IntentRecognizer Class

## Objective
To ensure that the IntentRecognizer class accurately identifies and processes various English language instructions into the correct programming intents across multiple programming languages.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Intent Recognition
- **Description**: Test that the IntentRecognizer can identify basic programming constructs such as loops, conditionals, and variable assignments.
- **Method**: Provide a set of English instructions and verify that the recognized intents match the expected programming constructs.
- **Expected Outcome**: The IntentRecognizer should correctly map English instructions to the corresponding programming intents.

### 2. Multi-language Support
- **Description**: Verify that the IntentRecognizer can distinguish between intents for different programming languages (C, C++, Python, and Java).
- **Method**: Provide English instructions specific to different programming languages and check the accuracy of the language-specific intent recognition using the `language_keywords` dictionary.
- **Expected Outcome**: The IntentRecognizer should correctly identify the programming language and map the instructions to the appropriate language-specific intents.

### 3. Complex Instruction Handling
- **Description**: Test the IntentRecognizer's ability to handle complex instructions that involve multiple programming concepts.
- **Method**: Input complex English instructions that combine several programming concepts and verify the accuracy of the recognized intents using CoreNLP for dependency parsing.
- **Expected Outcome**: The IntentRecognizer should accurately decompose complex instructions into individual intents representing each programming concept.

### 4. Ambiguous Instruction Resolution
- **Description**: Assess the IntentRecognizer's strategy for dealing with ambiguous English instructions.
- **Method**: Provide ambiguous instructions and evaluate the IntentRecognizer's response, whether it asks for clarification or makes an educated guess.
- **Expected Outcome**: The IntentRecognizer should either resolve the ambiguity correctly or request additional information to clarify the intent.

### 5. Error Handling
- **Description**: Ensure that the IntentRecognizer can gracefully handle errors in English instructions.
- **Method**: Input instructions with intentional errors and observe the IntentRecognizer's error handling and reporting mechanisms.
- **Expected Outcome**: The IntentRecognizer should identify errors in instructions and provide meaningful feedback without crashing.

### 6. NLP Techniques Validation
- **Description**: Verify the effectiveness of the advanced NLP techniques, particularly CoreNLP for dependency parsing.
- **Method**: Provide complex sentences and check if the dependency parsing correctly identifies the relationships between different parts of the instruction.
- **Expected Outcome**: The IntentRecognizer should accurately parse complex sentences and extract the correct programming intents.

## Test Execution
The tests will be automated using a unit testing framework and will be included in the continuous integration pipeline to ensure ongoing quality control. Each test scenario will be implemented as a separate test case, with multiple test methods to cover different aspects of each scenario.

## Reporting
Test results will be logged and reported, including any failures or unexpected behaviors. This will help in continuous improvement of the IntentRecognizer class and the overall system.
