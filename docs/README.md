# CodeTalkPython

## Project Description

CodeTalkPython is an innovative system that allows users to write and execute code using natural English instructions. This project supports a conversational interface similar to ChatGPT, making programming accessible and intuitive for everyone.

## Installation

To install CodeTalkPython, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/CodeTalkPython.git
   cd CodeTalkPython
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```

## Usage

To use the English Interpreter, simply run the following command and start typing your English instructions:

```
python english_execution_engine.py
```

Example interaction:

```
> Create a variable named 'counter' and set it to 10
The variable 'counter' has been created and set to 10.

> Increase 'counter' by 5
The value of 'counter' is now 15.

> If 'counter' is greater than 10, print 'Counter is high!'
Counter is high!
```

The system understands a variety of instructions, including but not limited to:
- Variable creation and manipulation
- Arithmetic operations
- Control flow statements
- Function definitions and calls
- List and dictionary operations
