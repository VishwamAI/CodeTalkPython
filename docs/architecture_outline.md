# Unified Interpreter System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of a unified interpreter system that directly interprets and executes English instructions without translating them into traditional programming languages.

## Components
- **NLP Engine**: Parses English instructions to extract intents and entities using advanced NLP techniques.
- **Intent Mapping**: A set of rules that maps recognized intents to specific computational operations.
- **Execution Engine**: Carries out the tasks corresponding to the mapped intents, effectively executing the English instructions.

## English Language Patterns and Intents
- Define common patterns and phrases that correspond to computational tasks.
- Establish a mapping between these patterns and the intents they represent.

## NLP Engine Development
- Utilize tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing to understand the structure and meaning of English instructions.
- Implement intent recognition to determine the action the user wants to perform.

## Execution Engine Implementation
- Develop a set of internal functions that correspond to the intents recognized by the NLP engine.
- Ensure the execution engine can handle a variety of tasks, such as variable management, control structures, and system-level operations.

## Testing and Refinement
- Create a comprehensive set of test cases to ensure the system accurately interprets and executes English instructions.
- Continuously refine the NLP engine and execution engine based on test results and user feedback.
