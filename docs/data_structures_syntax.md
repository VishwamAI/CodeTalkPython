2. Add an element to a list:
   "Add [element] to the [position] of [list_name]"
   Example: "Add grape to the end of fruits"
   Example: "Add mango to the beginning of fruits"

3. Remove an element from a list:
   "Remove [element] from [list_name]"
   Example: "Remove banana from fruits"

4. Access an element by index:
   "Get the [position] element from [list_name]"
   Example: "Get the first element from fruits"
   Example: "Get the last element from fruits"

## Dictionaries

1. Create a dictionary:
   "Create a dictionary named [dict_name] with key-value pairs [key1]:[value1], [key2]:[value2], ..."
   Example: "Create a dictionary named ages with key-value pairs Alice:25, Bob:30, Charlie:35"

2. Add a key-value pair to a dictionary:
   "Add [key]:[value] to [dict_name]"
   Example: "Add David:40 to ages"

3. Remove a key-value pair from a dictionary:
   "Remove [key] from [dict_name]"
   Example: "Remove Bob from ages"

4. Access a value by key:
   "Get the value for [key] from [dict_name]"
   Example: "Get the value for Alice from ages"

## Stacks

1. Create a stack:
   "Create a stack named [stack_name]"
   Example: "Create a stack named book_pile"

2. Push an element onto a stack:
   "Push [element] onto [stack_name]"
   Example: "Push 'The Great Gatsby' onto book_pile"

3. Pop an element from a stack:
   "Pop from [stack_name]"
   Example: "Pop from book_pile"

4. Peek at the top element of a stack:
   "Peek at [stack_name]"
   Example: "Peek at book_pile"

## Queues

1. Create a queue:
   "Create a queue named [queue_name]"
   Example: "Create a queue named checkout_line"

2. Enqueue an element:
   "Enqueue [element] to [queue_name]"
   Example: "Enqueue 'Customer A' to checkout_line"

3. Dequeue an element:
   "Dequeue from [queue_name]"
   Example: "Dequeue from checkout_line"

4. Peek at the front element of a queue:
   "Peek at the front of [queue_name]"
   Example: "Peek at the front of checkout_line"
