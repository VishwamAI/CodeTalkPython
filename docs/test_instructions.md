# Test Instructions for English Interpreter

## Variable Assignments
1. Create a variable named 'count' and set its value to 10.
2. Create a variable called 'name' and set it to "Alice".
3. Set the value of 'count' to twice its current value.

## Control Structures
4. If the value of 'count' is greater than 15, display "High count".
5. While 'count' is greater than 0, decrease 'count' by 1 and display its value.
6. Repeat the following 3 times: display "Hello, World!".
7. Try to divide 10 by 0. If an error occurs, display "Division by zero is not allowed".

## Function Definitions and Calls
8. Define a function called 'greet' that takes a 'name' parameter and displays "Hello, [name]!".
9. Call the 'greet' function with the value of the 'name' variable.
10. Define a function 'add' that takes two numbers and returns their sum.
11. Call the 'add' function with 5 and 7, and store the result in a variable called 'sum'.

## I/O Operations
12. Ask the user to enter their age and store it in a variable called 'user_age'.
13. Display the value of 'user_age' to the screen.
14. Write the value of 'sum' to a file named "result.txt".
15. Read the contents of "result.txt" and display them.

## Data Structure Operations
16. Create a list called 'fruits' with items 'apple', 'banana', and 'orange'.
17. Add 'grape' to the end of the 'fruits' list.
18. Remove 'banana' from the 'fruits' list.
19. Sort the 'fruits' list in alphabetical order.
20. Create a dictionary called 'person' with keys 'name' and 'age', and set their values to "Bob" and 30 respectively.

## Algorithm Execution
21. Find the largest number in the list [3, 7, 2, 9, 1] and store it in a variable called 'max_number'.
22. Calculate the factorial of 5 and store the result in a variable called 'factorial_result'.
23. Check if the number stored in 'user_age' is prime. If it is, display "Your age is a prime number".

## Error Handling and Complex Operations
24. Try to convert the string "hello" to a number. If an error occurs, display "Cannot convert string to number".
25. Create a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term, where n is provided as an argument.
