# English Syntax for Object-Oriented Programming Operations

## Class Definition

1. Create a class:
   "Create a class named [class_name]"
   Example: "Create a class named Car"

2. Define an attribute:
   "Add attribute [attribute_name] to [class_name]"
   Example: "Add attribute color to Car"

3. Define a method:
   "Add method [method_name] to [class_name] that takes [parameters] and does [action]"
   Example: "Add method drive to Car that takes speed and does print 'Driving at {speed} mph'"

## Object Instantiation and Manipulation

1. Create an object:
   "Create a [class_name] object named [object_name]"
   Example: "Create a Car object named my_car"

2. Set an attribute:
   "Set [attribute_name] of [object_name] to [value]"
   Example: "Set color of my_car to red"

3. Get an attribute:
   "Get [attribute_name] of [object_name]"
   Example: "Get color of my_car"

4. Call a method:
   "Call [method_name] on [object_name] with [arguments]"
   Example: "Call drive on my_car with speed 60"

## Inheritance

1. Create a subclass:
   "Create a class named [subclass_name] that inherits from [superclass_name]"
   Example: "Create a class named ElectricCar that inherits from Car"

2. Override a method:
   "Override method [method_name] in [subclass_name] to do [action]"
   Example: "Override method drive in ElectricCar to do print 'Driving silently at {speed} mph'"

## Polymorphism

1. Create an interface:
   "Create an interface named [interface_name] with methods [method1], [method2], ..."
   Example: "Create an interface named Vehicle with methods start_engine, stop_engine"

2. Implement an interface:
   "Make [class_name] implement [interface_name]"
   Example: "Make Car implement Vehicle"
