# Language Patterns and Intents Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the patterns and intents for various programming languages that the unified interpreter system will support. These patterns will be used by the `IntentRecognizer` class to map English instructions to language-specific operations.

## Supported Languages
- Python
- C
- C++
- Java

## Python Patterns and Intents
- Define common English patterns that correspond to Python operations.
- Map these patterns to intents that the `IntentRecognizer` can understand and process.

## C Patterns and Intents
- Document patterns for C language constructs and operations.
- Establish a mapping between these patterns and the intents they represent.

## C++ Patterns and Intents
- Outline patterns for C++ language features and idioms.
- Link these patterns to intents for the `IntentRecognizer` to recognize.

## Java Patterns and Intents
- Describe patterns for Java language syntax and semantics.
- Connect these patterns to intents that will trigger the corresponding Java operations.

## Intent Recognition Logic
- Implement the logic in the `IntentRecognizer` class to process English instructions and identify the corresponding programming language patterns and intents.

## Testing and Refinement
- Develop test cases for each programming language to ensure accurate intent recognition.
- Refine the pattern recognition logic based on test results and user feedback.
