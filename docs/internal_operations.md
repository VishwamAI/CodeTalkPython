# Internal Operations for Unified Interpreter System

## Overview
This document outlines the internal operations that the unified interpreter system will perform in response to recognized intents from English instructions.

## Intent to Operation Mapping
- Define a mapping between recognized intents and the internal operations that will be executed.

## Operations List
- **Variable Management**: Operations for creating, updating, and retrieving variables.
- **Control Structures**: Operations for executing loops, conditional statements, and branching.
- **Function Management**: Operations for defining and invoking functions.
- **List and Dictionary Operations**: Operations for manipulating lists and dictionaries.
- **File and Process Management**: Operations for handling files and system processes.
- **Network Operations**: Operations for managing network interactions.
- **System-Level Operations**: Operations for interacting with the operating system and performing system-level tasks.

## Implementation Details
- Describe the implementation approach for each operation, ensuring they are language-agnostic and directly executable.
- Ensure that operations are modular and can be extended or modified as the system evolves.

## Testing and Refinement
- Develop test cases for each operation to ensure they perform as expected.
- Continuously refine the operations based on test results and user feedback.
